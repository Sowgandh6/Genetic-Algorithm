# Genetic-Algorithm
Genetic algorithm (GA) is a process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected
for reproduction in order to produce offspring. Typically, GA has five phases: (a) Initial
population: the set of genes of an individual is represented using a string usually binary values
are used (0’s and 1’s), (b) Fitness score: This tells us how fit an individual is. This score tells us
the probability that an individual is selected for reproduction, (c) Selection: In this phase, the
fittest individuals are considered for reproducing the offsprings, (d) Crossover: Crossover is an
important part of GA. For the selected parents, a crossover point is chosen and offsprings are
created, (e) Mutation: New offsprings formed are further mutated at random points and this is
done to prevent premature convergence.
We developed a genetic method that employs crossover and mutation to aim to produce a string
of only 1's from a randomly generated bit string of length n. Throughout the experiment, several
values are chosen for the population size, individual size, drop percentage, crossover percentage,
and mutation percentage. Plots were created in accordance with the various fitness score values
that were acquired.
